## üå≥ Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We follow a simplified Git Flow:

- **`main`** - Production branch (stable releases)
  - Only contains tested, production-ready code
  - Releases are tagged as `v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0`, etc.
  - Direct commits are NOT allowed (only via PR)

- **`develop`** - Development branch (pre-releases)
  - Integration branch for features
  - Releases are tagged as `v0.2.0-develop.1`, etc.
  - Features are merged here first for testing

- **`feature/*`** - Feature branches
  - Created from `develop`
  - Merged back to `develop` via PR
  - Naming: `feature/add-jira-support`, `feature/improve-auth`

- **`hotfix/*`** - Hotfix branches
  - Created from `main` for critical fixes
  - Merged to both `main` AND `develop`
  - Naming: `hotfix/fix-critical-bug`

### Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Start a new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/add-new-command

# 2. Work on your feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new command for X"

# 3. Keep up to date with develop
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop

# 4. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/add-new-command
gh pr create --base develop

# 5. After PR is merged, delete local branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feature/add-new-command
```

## üìù Commit Message Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automatic versioning:

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

| Type | Description | Version Bump |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `feat` | New feature | Minor (0.x.0) |
| `fix` | Bug fix | Patch (0.0.x) |
| `docs` | Documentation only | No bump |
| `style` | Code style (formatting) | No bump |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring | No bump |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | Patch |
| `test` | Adding tests | No bump |
| `chore` | Build process/tools | No bump |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | No bump |

### Breaking Changes

Add `!` after type or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer for major version bump:

```bash
feat!: redesign configuration system

BREAKING CHANGE: Configuration file format has changed
```

### Examples

```bash
# Feature (minor bump)
git commit -m "feat: add support for Jira integration"

# Bug fix (patch bump)
git commit -m "fix: resolve timeout issue in Grafana API"

# Breaking change (major bump)
git commit -m "feat!: change config file format to TOML"

# With scope
git commit -m "feat(clickup): add custom field mapping"

# With body
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in alert processor

The alert processor was keeping references to old alerts.
This commit adds proper cleanup after processing.

Fixes #123"
```

## üöÄ Release Process

### Development Releases (Continuous)

Every merge to `develop` creates a pre-release automatically:

```bash
# Automatic on merge to develop
v0.2.0-develop.1
v0.2.0-develop.2
v0.2.0-develop.3
```

### Production Releases (Planned)

1. **Prepare Release**
   ```bash
   # Ensure develop is stable
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   
   # Run all tests
   make test
   make lint
   ```

2. **Create Release PR**
   ```bash
   # Create PR from develop to main
   gh pr create \
     --base main \
     --head develop \
     --title "Release v0.3.0" \
     --body "## Changes
   - feat: auto-upgrade system
   - fix: API timeout issues
   
   ## Testing
   - [x] All tests pass
   - [x] Manual testing completed
   - [x] Documentation updated"
   ```

3. **Review & Merge**
   - Code review by at least one maintainer
   - CI/CD checks must pass
   - Merge (triggers automatic release)

4. **Post-Release**
   ```bash
   # Update develop with main
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin main
   git push origin develop
   ```

## üè∑Ô∏è Versioning Strategy

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.2.3)
  - **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
  - **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
  - **PATCH**: Bug fixes

### Version Lifecycle

```
develop: 0.2.0-develop.1
   ‚Üì (feature added)
develop: 0.3.0-develop.1
   ‚Üì (more commits)
develop: 0.3.0-develop.2
   ‚Üì (release to main)
main: 0.3.0
   ‚Üì (hotfix)
main: 0.3.1
```

## üìã Release Checklist

git checkout -b hotfix/fix-critical-issue

# 2. Fix the issue
git commit -m "fix: resolve critical production issue"

# 3. Create PR to main
gh pr create --base main --title "Hotfix: Critical issue"

# 4. After merge, sync with develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin main
git push origin develop
```
